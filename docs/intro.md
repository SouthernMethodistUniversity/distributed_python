# Overview

Welcome to the SMU [Oâ€™Donnell Data Science and Research Computing
Institute](https://www.smu.edu/provost/odonnell-institute) (ODSRCI) workshop on
distributed Python computing! This workshop is designed for researchers seeking
to optimize their workflows for large-scale data processing and parallel
computing. Participants will explore the fundamentals of distributed computing
with Python, learning how to leverage Dask for efficient task parallelism and
Ray for scalable machine learning and reinforcement learning applications.
Through hands-on exercises, attendees will gain practical experience in
deploying these tools to handle massive datasets, optimize computational
resources, and streamline workflows.
