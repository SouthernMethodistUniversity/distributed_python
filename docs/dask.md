# Dask

## Overview

Dask is an open-source Python library designed for parallel computing, enabling
efficient scaling of data analysis workflows from single machines to large
distributed clusters. It extends familiar interfaces like NumPy, Pandas, and
scikit-learn, allowing users to handle larger-than-memory datasets and perform
complex computations with minimal code changes. Dask’s high-level
collections—such as DataFrames, Arrays, and Bags—facilitate parallel operations
on structured and unstructured data, while its dynamic task scheduler optimizes
execution across multiple cores or nodes. This versatility makes Dask suitable
for a wide range of applications, including retail demand forecasting,
large-scale image processing in life sciences, financial system modeling, and
geophysical data analysis.  ￼
